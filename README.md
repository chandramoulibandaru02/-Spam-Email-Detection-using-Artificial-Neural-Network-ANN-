# -Spam-Email-Detection-using-Artificial-Neural-Network-ANN-
This project demonstrates a machine learning model that detects spam emails using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model is trained on a dataset of emails with labeled spam and non-spam messages.
ðŸš€ Features
Input data preprocessing using TfidfVectorizer

Binary classification with ANN built using TensorFlow/Keras

Achieved 92% accuracy on the test set

Includes confusion matrix and classification report for evaluation

ðŸ§  Model Architecture
Input Layer: Based on TF-IDF feature vector (36,996 features)

Hidden Layers: 2 Dense layers with ReLU activation

Output Layer: 1 neuron with Sigmoid activation for binary classification

ðŸ—ƒ Dataset
Format: CSV file with two columns:

text: the email content

spam: label (1 for spam, 0 for ham)

ðŸ“¦ Libraries Used
Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy
